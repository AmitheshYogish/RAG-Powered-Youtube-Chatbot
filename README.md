# RAG-Powered-Youtube-Chatbot

## 1. Overview of the Project:
This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to transcribe and summarize YouTube videos, enabling interactive question-answering on the video content. It leverages various libraries and APIs to achieve this functionality.

## 2. How RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is used here:
The project utilizes a form of RAG by creating a vector database from the transcribed text of the YouTube video. This vector database is created using Chroma and OllamaEmbeddings. When a user asks a question related to the video content, the application retrieves relevant information from the vector database and uses the ChatGroq language model to generate a concise answer based on the retrieved context.

## 3. Complete Workflow of the Project:
   a. The user inputs a YouTube video link into the Streamlit application.
   b. The application downloads the audio from the YouTube video and saves it as an MP3 file.
   c. The MP3 file is uploaded to the AssemblyAI API for audio transcription.
   d. AssemblyAI transcribes the audio and provides a summarized text, along with detecting sensitive topics and categorizing the video's content into relevant topics.
   e. The transcribed text is split into chunks and converted into a vector database using Chroma and OllamaEmbeddings(Nomic-Embed-Text).
   f. The user can navigate to the "Video Summary" section to view the summary, sensitive topics, and content categories generated by AssemblyAI.
   g. In the "Video Q&A" section, the user can ask questions related to the video content.
   h. The application retrieves relevant information from the vector database based on the user's question.
   i. The retrieved context is passed to the ChatGroq language model(Mixtral8x7B), which generates a concise answer.
   j. The generated answer is displayed to the user in the Streamlit application.

This project showcases the integration of various technologies and APIs, including Streamlit for the user interface, AssemblyAI for audio transcription and content analysis, Chroma and OllamaEmbeddings for creating the vector database, and ChatGroq for generating answers based on the retrieved context.
